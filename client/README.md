## Front-end

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

### Available Scripts

Before running the application node_modules need to be installed with `npm install`
This has to be done in all directories (client, db, server) separately

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run db`


### `npm run server`


### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
